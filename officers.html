									<h3>Ezzme</h3>
									<p>Leader of Covenant of Blades</p>
								</header>
								<div class=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ScreenShot00091.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>“And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. 
									Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring﻿ passed out 
									of all knowledge.” <br/>― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings</p>
								<p>So this is where we begin.  As de facto leader of Covenant of Blades, I'd like to welcome 
									you to the kin. I know a few things i'll be glad to share and I have guild crafters 
									should you have need of one. If you want some company or would like some help I'm always 
									around, my alts are all ID'd in the roster notes, just send me a tell,  If you're lost, 
									I'll be lost with you. If you're not lost I'll probably still be lost.  If you want to 
									slay a dragon I'll be happy to go along.  
									Just remember “never laugh at live dragons”.</p>
								<p>"I should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required and remuneration, 
									and so forth"—by which he meant: "What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come 
									back alive?"  Please refer all inquires such as these to chatty 
									burgs.</p>
								<p>And finally. “Be bold, but wary! Keep up your merry hearts, and ride to 
									meet your fortune!” <br/>― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings</p>
								<p>Her alts include Adalinda, Cadossa, and Bozaroc.</p>

									<h3>Rod</h3>
									<p>Successor of Covenant of Blades, Raid Leader</p>
								</header>
								<div class=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/naked_dwarf.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>Rod likes sparring random people, doing raids, and eating lots of meat. He is the best at whatever he says he is.</p>
								<p>His alts include several other naked dwarves.</p>

									<h3>Lough</h3>
									<p>Officer at Large</p>
								</header>
								<div class=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ScreenShot00021.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>Hello all and welcome to CoB, I'd like to start by saying that I hope you enjoy the kin and any 
									and all contributions and ideas will be considered by the leadership, every member is 
									important and we want everyone to feel their ideas are important, because they are. 
									I am a stay at home dad, living in North Carolina USA. I can be on a lot more than i am, 
									but I am usually active from 12:00 pm EST until 4:00 pm.</p>
								<p>I have 26 characters in total, but 15 are mule and do nothing except hold gear. I have one of 
									each class on Landroval spread over a variety of levels. I have played through Ered Luin, 
									The Shire, and Bree, many times while deeding and have done the meta deed for all the areas 
									in Eriador and Moria at least a few times so I have a pretty good knowledge of what's where 
									and the best place to do slayers. I have some crafters who are capped, but not all crafts, 
									I am working on having at least 1 of each crafter who is completely guilded. I am also 
									willing to help or join just about anything time permitting, so always feel free to ask in 
									game, if i cannot help. there is almost certainly someone who can.</p>
								<p>My alts include Aerisdal, Seliarda, Lidasera, Ilsearda, and Reyel.</p>

									<h3>Vaekarra</h3>
									<p>Officer with a Family</p>
								</header>
								<div class=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ScreenShot00092.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>Welcome to our kinship! My husband and  I decided to make this kin home for all our 
									characters as we feel  this wonderful group of people made us feel like family.  
									This kin is  supportive, knowledgeable and resourceful. We are always open to 
									suggestions no matter how minor they may seem.</p>
								<p>I am a stay at home mother of 4 in Hartsville, TN and sometimes that mother leaks over 
									into our virtual world.  I have been playing on and off for about 8 years. Im 
									always looking for ways to improve my knowledge of my classes and insight on 
									how to make them better. I do a lot of skirmishes (as i find thats the best way 
									to test some new skill or play style).</p>
								<p>I'm happy to help in any way that I can, if i cant answer a question I will find someone who 
									can.  I have doomfold tier in all professions except metalsmith, guilded but not fully at this time.</p>
								<p>My alts are listed in the in game kin roster notes and are Dydora, Dorfina, Dorkkina, Damareth, 
									Hulna, Havanath, Snapplez, Trifla, Vaekarra.</p>

									<h3>Owyyn</h3>
									<p>Officer with a Clue</p>
								</header>
								<div class=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ScreenShot00001.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>Heya!  Welcome to Covenant of Blades.  I look forward to growing as a player and a leader 
									in this kinship.</p>
								<p>I'm an avid gamer and have been with LOTRO since beta.  I currently have 15 active toons 
									and a decent knowledge of the game.  I am always looking to learn new aspects of the 
									game, even after 11 years, so feel free to share your expertise with me.</p>
								<p>My alts include: Ottr, Gladruf, Angrunir, and many others.</p>

									<h3>Dram</h3>
									<p>Officer in Hiding</p>
								</header>
								<div class=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ScreenShot00002.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>Greetings and welcome to the Covenant of Blades site. I am glad to be part of something 
								   where everyone feels valued and camaraderie is shared by all. Landroval is my original 
								   server, and I am glad to be back after a few years.</p>
								<p>I have a handful of toons that I tinker around, but Dramborn is my main. I am amused by roleplay,
								   but I find most of it is done poorly. 
								   <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dramborn/home" target="_blank">
									   (Feel free to check out Dramborn's backstory here.)</a>
								   I am a Tolkien geek, and enjoy doing trivia games centered
								   around Middle Earth lore. If you happen to join Covenant of Blades, then I will most likely
								   pester you with a bunch of questions and group invites. Dramborn is a chatty burg.
								<p>My alts include Blaic, Dramwise, Fangryn, Meadwine, Skarhd, Valaith, Warbacon, and Zoolandir.</p>
