								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The following information outlines the steps you must take if you 
								   have joined Covenant of Blades as a Recruit. These actions are 
								   designed to help our Officers and Members learn more about you
								   and help you feel welcome. No minimum or maximum time frame 
								   exists, but we would prefer to promote you sooner than later!</p>
								<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

									<h2>Membership Requirements</h2>
									<p><i>Although the requirements are numbered, they can be done in any order you like</i></p>
								</header>
								
								<h3>1. Read this website!</h3>
								<p>By coming to this website, you have taken the first step towards
								   membership. Make sure you read through all the requirements so 
								   that you understand them. The kinship leaders do not have a huge 
								   list of do's and don'ts, or a charter with rules and bylaws. 
								   Instead, our leaders adhere to the following statement.</p>

								<h4>Leadership Statement</h4>
								<blockquote>A kinship is a family, and a covenant means "to walk together". 
								The leadership of Covenant of Blades exists to be good examples of
							    collaboration and unity. We invited you to be part of this family 
								and we reserve the right to remove you if we see fit.</blockquote>
								
								<hr />
								
								<h3>2. Kinship Note</h3>
								<p>We would like to know which characters are yours while you are playing.
								   So, use the images below and follow these instructions.</p>
								   <ul>
										<li>While in-game, open the Kinship panel (one of the tabs on the 
										Social panel). You will see a list of all members and where they 
										are located on the map.</li>
										<li>If you click on the small button next to the word "Location", then it
										will toggle to "Player Note".</li>
										<li>Now click on the "Note" button near the bottom of the panel. This
										will open a text box for you to enter your note.</li>
										<li>Click the "Update" button. You are done!</li>
										</ul>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row 50% uniform">
										<div class="4u 12u(medium)"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/img_panel_01.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="4u 12u(medium)"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/img_panel_02.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="4u 12u$(medium)"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/img_panel_03.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>Make sure to identify your Main (the primary character you play while in the kin),
								and then reference all your alts to the Main's name. For instance, if your Main is
								called "Frodo", then you would enter the note "Main" on that character. Then, all of 
								your alts would have something like "Frodo's alt" in their notes.</p>

								<hr />
								
								<h3>3. Take the Survey</h3>
								<p>A short survey has been developed to find out what interests you
								   might have regarding LOTRO and what sort of player you are. This 
								   survey only takes a couple of minutes, but it allows our leaders to see
								   the demographics of the kinship and adjust our activities to meet
								   the needs of the members.</p>
								<p>Take the survey here: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/YJCmN6YkrTUUIYa42" target="_blank">Covenant of Blades Membership Survey</a> </p>

								<hr />
								
								<h3>4. Join our Discord Server</h3>
								<div class=""><a href="https://discord.gg/4JYepQ9"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/discord_banner.png" alt="" /></span></a></div>
								<p>The free app <a href="http://discordapp.com" target="_blank">Discord</a> is one of the most 
								   powerful and simple online services for developing teams and organizations. Although it is 
								   primarily a voice chat service, it also includes text chat boards, which we use to share
								   information based on your role in the kinship. In order to be promoted to full membership, 
								   you must create a free Discord account and log into our server.
								   </p>
								<p>Click on the image above or join us at <a href="https://discord.gg/4JYepQ9">tiny.cc/cob-discord</a>.

								<hr />
								
								<h3>5. Participate in an Officer-led Event</h3>
								<p>We do all sorts of things together, and not all of them require raid gear and a lot of end-game focus. 
								   We farm LOTRO points. We help one another complete slayer deeds. We may quest together. The most important 
								   part of this for you as a recruit is to pay attention and respond on the kinship chat channel. You might 
								   ask to join or ask to be joined. Either way, we want to know who you are and how you play.</p>
